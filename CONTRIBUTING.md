## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/olaflaitinen/fetal-plane-explorer/issues)

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific!
    -   Give sample code if you can.
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happened
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

*   **TypeScript**: We use `eslint` and `prettier`. Run `npm run lint` before submitting.
